# OnSystemChat

This project took more than ten hours to try to design a native messaging infrastructure.
Its database is a bit complicated, you can check and view its queries.

It was a very interesting and good experience.

## Features

- [x] Pure websocket (Not socket.io)
- [x] Auth/Login
- [x] Chat
- [x] Private Chat
- [x] Group Chat
- [x] Auto-reconnect
- [x] Detect list of online users and active rooms

## Using

```
node app.js
```
Open the `http://localhost:5000/` in the browser.

If you easily want to test and debug, there are some test links:

- `http://localhost:5000/?u=1`
- `http://localhost:5000/?u=2`
- `http://localhost:5000/?u=3`
- `http://localhost:5000/?u=4`

## Database

Mariadb, please import `onsystem.sql` file and put your database configuration details in `app.js` file.
